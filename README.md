# INST326_Final-Project


#PROBLEM: I can never keep track of all my contacts because I have too many friends. I'm just too popular for my own good. 


# Overview of the project. 
The reason why we chose this topic is because it is a common problem for many people and we as well can benefit from a solution. The issue that we are trying to solve is having a disorganized contact list. The solution is taking in a text file of the information per contact and sorting them. Sorting will be completed in alphabetical order and prioritize from first name, last name, the email address, and other tie-breakers. This will be completed through the applications of GitHub and Visual Studios. The reason we seek this project is because we are aware of the common problem and would like to address it.
