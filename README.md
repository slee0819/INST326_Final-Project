# INST326_Final-Project


# PROBLEM:
I can never keep track of all my contacts because I have too many friends. I'm just too popular for my own good. 


# Overview of the project. 
The reason why we chose this topic is because it is a common problem for many people and we as well can benefit from a solution. The issue that we are trying to solve is having a disorganized contact list. The solution is taking in a text file of the information per contact and sorting them. Sorting will be completed in alphabetical order and prioritize from first name, last name, the email address, and other tie-breakers. This will be completed through the applications of GitHub and Visual Studios. The reason we seek this project is because we are aware of the common problem and would like to address it.

# Scope of the project. 
Our topic is about the contacts list. It mainly includes the contact's phone number, name, and notes. The program will list contacts alphabetically by first name, last name, email address, and other tie-breakers. The program will also include a priority preference setting in which the user can choose how they want their contacts organized. Example: first, last, email, frequently used, etc. The scope of the audience in which we aim to help with this problem are clutery people. The actions that the program will not be able to do is update the contact’s picture, personal ringtone, and social media profile. The scope of the project is feasible because our team is organized and in agreement with the project breakdown. In addition, we are aware that some divisions of labor are harder than others, which is why we have incorporated more time into those sections.

# Project breakdown and division of labor. 
*Division of labor: We listed the software components down below and we are all working together throughout this process. We have all agreed to work together in sections rather than splitting code. Our group believes we will work best if we tackle this project in these steps towards the solution. Each member is required to write/take lead on 2 functions. The main non-programming task we will have to do is create our own database of a disorganized list. The group will handle this together through a shared document.
Receive list of contacts: April 8th - April 12th
Sorting: how to do it and what’s priority: April 12th - April 22th
Grouping: April 22th - April 30th 
Updating: April 30 th - May 10th

# Meetings and communication. 
Meetings and communications will be scheduled first through text messages. In case the meeting cannot be made, we expect to meet with Zoom. Also, for overall flexibility when coding, we plan to use a shared repository like Github. Everyone in the group is in a group chat and is aware that there are weekly meetings, unless told otherwise.

# Schedule and milestones. 
We plan to have time to check once a week to keep the project consistent. Our group is aware that projects has important deadline and will  I also try to prepare everything a week or two in advance because I know I need to prepare a presentation as well.
